root cause of engine with electronic ignition timing deviation to the point of catastrophic change is the intentional placement of; alternating current capped beam, on vehicle engine, causing; overheating of emissions catalytic converters, causing; honeycomb filter material interior to melt/mesh, closed; restricting exhaust passage.

*fix:shoot the low-orbiting artificial "space" satellites out of here!

*temporary fix:"wheep hole"(depending on stage and length of beaming(ie. new vehicle no millage;1/16-5/64, etc. so forth, may require replacement with pre drilled), drilled foward in the emissions catalytic converter; in foward center converter conical structure, not the cylinderical exhaust pipe.
