The True Calculated Speed of Light
 ( c = 0 )
by: Dr. Thomas Catalano, Ph.D
We have referenced the "Speed of Light" with two distinct quantities, yet the notions of permeability are irrelevant, 
when in fact listing it as "in vacuum" or "in a median" is as denoting as its description of its state. How the relevance and relationship
by which entropy and Light have been misplaced circumvents its conception and measurable state. The fundamental principles that govern the rule have been 
conjured by countless and boundless theories that do not sustain the truth. The proven scientific calculation requires the mandate to forgo past descriptors of proven
experimental results. The notation of Light is the static constant where it applies to all states of matter as the foundation of all
quadrants of space, in all references, the photonic event is the quadrant in which the mathematical expression is seeked which has been used
as the measurement of so which it is not, this requires it own underlying symbol not related to 
Light that is and always will be the static constant.
