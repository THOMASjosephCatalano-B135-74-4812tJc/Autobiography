is a digital image of atmospheric "aggregate" used to visualize
"atmospheric difference's" in Earth geo state. Clearly visible is the central local;mt.Evans mountain range,
and fig.2-3 meters pressure/wave differentials via cloud formation and photonic
distribution. mt.Evans is a "portal" to the center of the Earth and interior locations of the mountain
will cave areas to view a where a medium-large cavity resides in the mountains interior at fig.1(a paired transcendeel rock mountain formation 
SW of mt.Evans(mt.Evans also shows evidence of a smaller cavity area inside the mountains interior to view observable/visible rays exactly/similar as Earth's "Sun".
