is a digital image of atmospheric "aggregate" used to visualize
"atmospheric difference's" in Earth geo state. Clearly visible is the central local;mt.Evans,
and fig.2-3 meters pressure/wave differentials via cloud formation and photonic
distribution. mt.Evans is a "portal" to the center of the Earth and interior locations of the mountain
will cave areas to view a "peep hole" that will illuminate observable/visible rays exactly/similar as Earth's "Sun".
